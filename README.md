# threeJS

This are my three.js Journey class files they should be all working good. to run it:
  
### 1. cd into a specific class.
  
### 2. npm install
  
### 3. npm run dev
  
  
## Boilerplate: 26-code-structuring-project

  All files contain specific information. Folder 26-code-structuring-projects cointains a very detailed BOILERPLATE 
  for bigger projects with all the pieces divided in folders and classes.
